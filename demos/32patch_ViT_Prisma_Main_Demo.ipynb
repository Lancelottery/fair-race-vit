        "\n",
        "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce readers to vision transformer (ViT) mechanistic interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make ViT mechanistic interpretability easier, I built an [open source library Prisma](https://github.com/soniajoseph/ViT-Prisma). The library is based on Neel Nanda's fantastic [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) but adapted for vision transformers and text-image models like CLIP. This notebook serves as a demo of the library. I highly encourage readers to check out the library and request features that they'd like to see!\n",
        "\n",
        "I hope this notebook builds the vision mech interp ecosystem and encourages researchers to pursue their own directions with Prisma!\n",

        "## Audience\n",
        "This notebook is geared toward two audiences. The first is familiar with language mech interp, but not vision mech interp. The second is somewhat new to mechanistic interpretability, but is familiar with basic deep learning and has some mild exposure to mech interp concepts. If you are *completely* new to all mech interp, I recommend getting the basics down with the [ARENA curriculum](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0) first.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure of this notebook is based on the excellent notebook [Exploratory Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=lZgu7cH72kdd) from TransformerLens, with some detours. While this notebook acts as a stand-alone, I encourage readers to consult the original notebook when they would like a deeper explanation.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Vision mech interp is like language mech interp, but in a fun-house mirror. Both architectures are transformers, so many LLM techniques carry over. However, there are a few twists:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The typical ViT is not doing unidirectional sequence modeling.** ViTs use bidirectional attention and predict a global CLS token, rather than predicting the next token in an autoregressive manner. (Note: There are autoregressive vision transformers with basically the same architecture as language, such as [Image GPT](https://openai.com/research/image-gpt) and [Parti](https://sites.research.google/parti/), which do next-token image generation. However, as of February 2024, autoregressive vision transformers are not frequently used in the wild.)\n",
        "* **Bidirectional attention vs causal attention.** Language transformers have causal (unidirectional) attention. This means that there is an upper triangular mask on the attention, so that earlier tokens cannot attend to tokens in the future. The classical ViT, with its bidirectional attention, does not have the same concept of \"time.\" Thus, some of the original LLM mech interp techniques break. It can be unclear which direction information is flowing. Induction heads, if they are present in vision, would look different from those in language to account for bidirectional attention.\n",
        "* **CLS token instead of next token prediction/ autoregressive loss.** For ViTs, a learnable CLS token, which is prepended to the input, gets fed into the classification head instead of the final token as in language. The CLS token accrues global information from the other patches through self-attention as all the patches pass through the net.\n",
        "* **No canonical dictionary matrix. Vision is more ambiguous.** Vision lacks a standard dictionary matrix like the 50k one for language, partially due to inherent ambiguity. For instance, a yellow patch on a goldfinch might represent \"yellow,\" \"wing,\" \"goldfinch,\" \"bird,\" or \"animal,\" depending on the granularity, demonstrating hierarchical ambiguity. An animal might be identified specifically as a \"Border collie\" or more generally as a \"dog.\" Beyond hierarchy, ambiguity in vision also stems from cultural interpretations and the imprecision of language. Practically, ImageNet's 1000 classes serve as a makeshift \"dictionary,\" but it falls short of fully encompassing visual concepts.\n",
        "* **Additional hyperparameters.** Patch size is a vision-specific hyperparameter, determining the size of the patches into which an image is divided. Using smaller patches increases accuracy but also computational load, because attention scales quadratically with patch number.\n",
        "* **There is a zoo of vision transformers.** Similar to language, vision transformers come in many forms. The most relevant are the vanilla ViT, which we'll be analyzing in this notebook; CLIP, which is co-trained with text using contrastive loss; and DINO uses unlabeled data. For a review, check out [this survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01169.pdf).\n"

        "The logit difference between two classes, rather than the raw logit value itself, is often considered a more reliable measure. This is because when subtracting one logit from another, any arbitrary constants inherent in the logits cancel out. The design of cross-entropy loss focuses specifically on the differences between class logits, which can result in the logits being adjusted by an arbitrary constant. For a more in-depth explanation, refer to the mechanism interpretation explainer [here](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=disz2gTx-jooAcR0a5r8e7LZ) or the original Exploratory Analysis notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=tGz70kpdiPzs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Contrary to the initial Indirect Object Identification (IOI) analysis, which focuses on the logit differences between two classes, my approach considers the raw logit value of a single class. Observing a box plot of all logit values reveals that, on average, the values are near zero for every layer (indicated by the red dot). Therefore, the notion of biases neutralizing each other, as seen in the logit difference case, does not hold here since the average logit value is zero.\n",
